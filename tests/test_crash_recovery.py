"""Phase 4 hardening — crash recovery (spec §5.3, §9 RPC-integration row).

Proves: kill a worker mid-job -> its lease expires -> the job is reclaimed and
requeued -> a replacement finishes it -> the reclaimed/double-run job cannot create
a second artifact (UNIQUE(saga_id, step, target_id)) -> the saga completes.

Three angles:
  - store level:  lease -> crash (no write) -> reclaim -> re-lease -> write, then the
                  resurrected crashed worker double-writes -> still exactly ONE artifact.
  - supervisor:   end-to-end onboarding saga with the enrich worker dying mid-job on the
                  first attempt (ProcessDied) -> requeued -> second attempt succeeds ->
                  extract + link run -> saga 'done', entity 'ready', one artifact per step.
  - transport:    a real child process is SIGKILLed via its process group (close()),
                  proving the "kill a worker" mechanic actually reaps the OS process.
