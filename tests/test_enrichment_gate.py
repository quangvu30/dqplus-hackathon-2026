"""Enrichment gate unit tests. Pure, no DB.

The `link` stage must mark entities whose enrichment found no verifiable data as
`status='unverified'` (not `'ready'`) so matching — which only pulls ready entities —
skips them. Regression guard for the Touchstone Partners case: a nonexistent seed
(NXDOMAIN domain, no corroborating source) that was persisted as 'ready' and entered
matching with an all-null profile.
